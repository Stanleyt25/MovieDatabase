movies.sql is a file containing SQL commands to set up and populate data tables of interest, containing entries such as genre, rating, motion picture title, etc.

PA1.2.php contains PHP code that sets up a text field in which users can enter queries, as well as a series of buttons that allows the user to display all of the motion pictures, actors, series, movies, genres, and locations.

PA1.3.php builds on top of PA1.2 and contains PHP code that expands on the user functionality in PA1.2.php. For instance, it displays actors sharing a birthday or the top rated films of a certain genre. Furthermore, it grants users to provide their email and "like" movies.
